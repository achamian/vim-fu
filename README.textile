Attempting to combine the awesomeness of various vim plugins in one easy configurable unit.

To install, there's a few rake tasks you should know:
@rake preinstall@ Pulls down git submodules.
@rake install@ Copies files over to ~/.vim

And if you need to:
@rake uninstall@ Deletes ~/.vim
@rake reinstall@ Uninstall, install.

Also, if you want to update the submodules:
@rake update@ Does a git pull on each of them. You'll need to do a commit yourself.

If you want to add your own folders, plugins, or what have you, feel free! Just put whatever files you want in the @personal@ folder. Check out the @Rakefile@ and go for it.
