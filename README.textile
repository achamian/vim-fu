Attempting to combine the awesomeness of various vim plugins in one easy configurable unit.

To install, there's a few rake tasks you should know:
@rake preinstall@ Pulls down git submodules.
@rake install@ Copies files over to ~/.vim
@rake uninstall@ Deletes ~/.vim

And some meta tasks:
@rake full_install@ Preinstalls, uninstall, install.
@rake reinstall@ Uninstall, install.

If you want to add your own folders, plugins, or what have you, feel free! Just put whatever files you want in the @personal@ folder. Check out the @Rakefile@ and go for it.
